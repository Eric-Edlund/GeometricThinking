The discussion and social media is low quality trash. People trying to understand
the world and form intelligent opinions about it have to wade through reactionary
emotional, incorrect content. It is complete garbage information wise.

I want a platform where facts and logic are central. When I hear about something
in the news, I go here to explore the facts of the idea collaboratively. I also
want to hear people's opinions and hot takes, but they need to be neatly labeled
so I can see facts first. I think that the type of high quality human thought I
want to experience can be facilitated by computers.

I believe that most people are capable of performing this high quality thinking
when set up for success. I think the geometry of traditional social media platforms
are not designed to facilitate intelligent discussion.

Is a post as the root of a tree optimal?

Is a verbal conversation optimal?

Is a socratic dialouge optimal?

I don't think so. Here's my feeling for what the platform I want allows users to
acheive:

- They can represent complex issues with all their components persistently so that
  they don't forget things.
- They can explore complex ideas in small pieces so they can think without being
  overwhelmed.
- Clear separation of facts and emotions.
- Clear ranking of specific and measurable facts.
- Observe connections between facts and conclusions

But let me narrow it down further:

- Separate facts and emotions, allowing for a shared sense of reality.
- Make system thinking concrete, structured, and navigable.

Now the mission is how best to facilitate this.
