1. The platform does not decide truth.

Users will not tollerate having conclusions drawn for them. We don't check facts.
We don't tell people their opinions are wrong. That's not how thinking works.

We facilitate thought. When we do our job well, the truth emerges on it's own.
Whatever that may be.

2. Emotions are not facts.

People have emotions and emotions are very important who we are as humans. That
said, emotions left unchecked can separate us from reality and lead to social
degeneracy. This platform aids us in synchronizing our emotions with reality.

3. Collective thought is not thought.

When a user enters the site, there are no social cues. There are no likes,
no dislikes, and to the greatest extent possible, no indication of popularity or
alignment with popular opinion. There is no space for virtue signaling, shaming,
political activism, or any form of social coersion.

We are here to explore ideas. Only looking at what is popular is not exploring.
This platform's goal is to separate emotions from critical reasoning. Part of
that is realizing when you're blindly repeating what someone else is saying.

4. Emotions are important.

Emotions are what motivate us to think. There is nothing else. The only time we
think is when it's emotionally interesting. This platform does not supress emotional
content. Emotions are at the center of everything this platform will ever do.

Emotions are everywhere and the goal of this platform is to identify them and separate
them from objective reality and stop them from interfering with our thinking.
This doesn't mean dismissing them, it means acknowledging them thinking hard about them.

5. Clarity matters.

Emotions have a lot of sneaky ways of undermining intelligent discussion. One way
they do this is through assumptions. Intelligent discussion depends on actual 
communication, and communication cannot happen when the words we say don't have 
definitive meaning.

Ideas which are not expressed clearly cannot be discussed directly. They need
clarification. They need questions.

Ideas which cannot be expressed clearly are not real ideas. They are often emotions,
and when seen for what they are, they can usually be expressed clearly as emotional
ideas and then discussed.

6. One thing at a time.

Ideas can get complicated quickly and complexity can spiral. When this happens, 
thinking becomes impossible. Keep units of communication atomic. Ask one question
at a time, present one fact. Don't ramble. Let the computer connect everything up.
Less is almost always more.

The things you say need to stand only in the limited context they have.
