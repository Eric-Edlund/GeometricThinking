Some ideas from Grok:

- Emotional nodes need to have a linked fact
- Graph might have phases during which emotional additions are banned
  to enforce logical structure to emerge.
- Ruthless ai enforcement of recognizing emotions.
- Emotion as currency: Points by adding logic and facts, then spend them to give
  opinions.

---

How interactive is it?

- Can people give reactions to any node?
- Are reactions members of the graph?
- Can people post facts independently?
- Can people react to facts?

What's the role of emotional content?

- I want to know what people feel
- What people feel is important
- We need to be able to talk about important things

How essential is convergent truth to the platform?

Why are people here?

- 

How do questions work?

- We can't make this just a top down thing. For it to be fun, we need interaction.
- Can you react to a fact? Or do you only get to ask questions?

Picking a node set:

- Disjoint
- Separates emotion from facts
- 

---

Node = Fact | Conclusion | Question | Emotional

Fact: Claim {
  - falsifiable
  - specific
  - based in reality
  - text is evidence
}

Conclusion: Claim {
  - depends on facts
  - text is a logical argument
}

Question<A: Claim | Emotional> {
  - text describes a fact
  - answerable
}


---

Node = Statement | Question
